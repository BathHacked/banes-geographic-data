## Introduction

As part of our work at [Bath: Hacked](http://www.bathhacked.org) we try to publish all of our data in our [Datastore](https://data.bathhacked.org). While that goes some way to working with & presenting geographic data, much facility is lost. This repository is designed to make it easier to share, create and work with data which has a geographic basis.

We have collected together subsets of many national datasets & joined them together with geographic data, where necessary.

[Bath & North East Somerset Council](http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/) have also kindly provided us with some of their own data about the area.

**Feel free to submit pull requests.**

## Subsetting

Where needed, all files were subsetted (clipped) to the area of Bath & North East Somerset, using the file `os_boundary.geojson` or, where available in the data, using the ONS code for BANES (E06000022).

## Spatial Reference System

All files use the WGS 84 / EPSG:4326 spatial reference system. This is to provide maximum compatibility with common web-based mapping tools.

## Licencing & Attribution

Where attribution is marked as **Mandatory** you **must** display the relevant attribution prominently alongside your use of the data. Typically by overlaying on a map or, where impractical, via a prominent link.

Where attribution is marked as **Optional** we strongly encourage you to include the attribution. It's only fair to credit the source.

For bonus points we'd like it if you'd add a **"Powered by Bath: Hacked"** attribution.

While we have endeavoured to provide consistent & accurate information about licencing & attribution of the data, we advise that you perform your own checks & due diligence in using the data, especially if you use the data commercially. Your use of this data is at your own risk.

We believe to the best of our knowledge that all data can be published as open data. If you believe that we have made an error please contact us immediately to remedy the situation.

## How To Use These Files

The files provided in this repository are intended for use with web-based mapping tools and geographical information systems.

Some recommended web tools include [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/), [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/), [Google Maps](https://www.google.co.uk/maps).

For manipulating the files we strongly recommend use of [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/) software. It is tremendously powerful & available for many platforms.

#### Output Area Classifications 2011

Area classifications group together geographic areas according to key characteristics common to the population in that grouping. These groupings are called clusters and are derived using census data. The area classifications are hierarchical classifications, consisting of three tiers: Supergroups, Groups and Subgroups.
